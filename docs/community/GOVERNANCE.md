# WayruCO Governance

## Overview

WayruCO is governed by its community with a commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralization. This document outlines our governance structure, decision-making processes, and how community members can participate.

## Governance Principles

### 1. Transparency
- All decisions are made publicly
- Rationale is documented and shared
- Community has access to decision-making processes
- Regular updates on project status

### 2. Inclusivity
- All community members can participate
- Multiple ways to contribute and have voice
- Diverse perspectives are valued
- Barriers to participation are minimized

### 3. Meritocracy
- Decisions based on merit and evidence
- Expertise is recognized and valued
- Contributions are evaluated fairly
- Leadership earned through demonstrated commitment

### 4. Decentralization
- Power is distributed, not concentrated
- Regional autonomy for local networks
- Decisions made at appropriate levels
- Gradual transition to full decentralization
