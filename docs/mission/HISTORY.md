# Wayru Network History

## The Beginning: A Vision for Digital Rights

Wayru Network was founded on a simple but powerful idea: internet access should be a human right, not a luxury. In a world where billions of people lack reliable internet connectivity, and where centralized providers control access and data, Wayru set out to build an alternative.

## Wayru Inc. Era (2018-2024)

### Founding Vision

Wayru Inc. was established with the mission to create decentralized internet infrastructure that communities could own and operate. The founders believed that:

- Communities should control their own infrastructure
- Internet access should be affordable and reliable
- Users should own their data and digital identity
- Technology should serve humanity, not corporate interests

### Early Development (2018-2020)

The team began building the core technology:

- **Network Protocol**: Developed mesh networking protocols for reliable connectivity
- **Node Software**: Created lightweight software for running network nodes
- **Token Economy**: Designed incentive mechanisms for node operators
- **Smart Contracts**: Built blockchain-based reward distribution

### Growth Phase (2020-2022)

Wayru expanded its reach and capabilities:

- **First Deployments**: Launched pilot networks in Southeast Asia and Africa
- **Community Partnerships**: Collaborated with NGOs and local organizations
- **Technology Maturation**: Hardened core systems for production use
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Released SDKs and APIs for third-party development

### Scaling Efforts (2022-2024)

The network grew significantly:

- **Node Growth**: Deployed 1,000+ nodes across 30+ countries
- **User Base**: Reached 10+ million users with improved internet access
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Partnered with major organizations for infrastructure
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Worked with governments on policy frameworks

## The Transition: From Company to Community

### Wayru Inc.'s Decision

In 2024, Wayru Inc. made a historic decision: to transition the core technology to community ownership. The company recognized that:

1. **Decentralization Requires Decentralization**: A centralized company couldn't truly serve a decentralized mission
2. **Sustainability**: Community-owned projects are more resilient than company-dependent ones
3. **Alignment**: Open governance better serves the mission than corporate interests
4. **Impact**: Community stewardship enables faster growth and innovation

### The Open Source Transition

Wayru Inc. released all mission-critical repositories under open source licenses:

- **Core Infrastructure**: Network protocols and node software
- **Smart Contracts**: Token economy and reward systems
- **SDKs and Tools**: Developer resources and APIs
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and specifications

### Key Repositories Released

The transition included 20+ critical repositories:

- **wayru-os**: Core operating system for network nodes
- **network-services**: Mesh networking and routing
- **rewards-system-program**: Token economy and incentives
- **explorer-web**: Network monitoring and analytics
- **mobile-app**: User-facing applications
- And many more...

## WayruCO: Community-Driven Future
